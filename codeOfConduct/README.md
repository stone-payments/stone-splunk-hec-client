# Code of Conduct Guideline

## The Dream

We at Stone want to encourage a welcoming, happy and collaborative environment where new ideas can flourish and be discussed respectfully. Our strength comes from our diversity and we always seek participation from those who magnify it.

## Our standards

- **Be welcoming and friendly** : We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

- **Be considerate** : Your work will be used by other people and you, in turn, will depend on other people&#39;s work. Every and any decision you make will affect others, so be mindful of them when taking decisions.
- **Be respectful** : We will not agree all the time – we&#39;re different human beings – our strength resides in that. Criticize and take criticism calmly and respectfully. It&#39;s normal to feel frustrated, but we are professionals, so act accordingly: do not let your nerves get over your attitude, do not waste energy fighting colleagues, use it instead on solving problems. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
- **Take responsibility for your words and actions** : We will err and make mistakes, that&#39;s how learning and improving works, so we take responsibility for them. If someone is harmed or offended, we will do everything at our reach to right the wrong.
- **Be collaborative** : What we produce is a complex whole made of many parts, it is the sum of many dreams. Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and vision is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole.
- **Ask for help when unsure** : The purpose here is sharing, helping each other out and growing together, so ask questions freely. Those who are asked should be responsive and polite, but what will really make them eager to help is they seeing you tried your best to find an answer yourself, so make sure you do your homework.

## What isn't acceptable

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, age, regional discrimination, political or religious affiliation

## Scope

## What does the Code of Conduct mean for me?

Our Code of Conduct means that you are responsible for treating everyone on the community with respect and courtesy regardless of their identity. If you are the victim of any inappropriate behavior or comments as described in our Code of Conduct, we are here for you and will do our best to ensure that the abuser is reprimanded appropriately, per our code. Remember: The Code is here for you, not against you. Live by the Code.
